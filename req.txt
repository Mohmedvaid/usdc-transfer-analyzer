3. Blockchain Interaction
   - Implement functionality to query USDC transfers (ERC-20 token standard) with C-Chain.
   - Filter and identify USDC contract addresses and transfer event signatures.
   - Deliverable: Architecture design document & initial connection code.

4. Data Aggregation & API Development

   - README with setup and application running instructions.
   - Technical documentation of architecture and design decisions.
   - Deploy application (optional but recommended if possible).

8. Submission
   - Upload code to a private GitHub repository.
   - Add collaborators: Lekky71, mubarakbello, lifeisgooddev, ponyjackal.
   - Email the repository link and details to Oluwaleke.
