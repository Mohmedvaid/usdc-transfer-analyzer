# Project Architecture Document

This document outlines the architecture of a Node.js application designed to interface with the Avalanche blockchain, focusing on wallet and transaction management.

## Overview

The application is structured around Express.js, leveraging middleware for request handling, MongoDB for data persistence, and scheduled tasks for updating transactions in real time.

## Application Setup

### Entry Point: src/app.js

- Initializes the application, setting up essential configurations and middleware.
- Establishes database connection unless running in TEST environment.
- Schedules transaction update tasks in PRODUCTION environment.

### Environment Configuration

- Environment variables are managed through `.env` files, facilitating the configuration of server parameters, database connections, and external APIs.

## Middleware Integration

Middleware plays a crucial role in request processing, error handling, and enhancing API responses.

### Standard Response and Error Handling

- `src/middleware/standardRes.js` and `src/middleware/standardErr.js` standardize API responses and error messages, ensuring consistency across the application.

### Rate Limiting

- `src/middleware/rateLimiter.js` limits the number of requests a user can make to the API within a certain timeframe, protecting against abuse.

### CORS and Credentials

- Configured in `src/config/corsOptions.config.js`, CORS middleware controls which domains are allowed to access the API.
- `src/middleware/credentials.js` manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings, ensuring security in client-server communication.

### Request Logging

- Morgan is used for logging request details, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

## Database Models

Mongoose models define the structure of documents within MongoDB, facilitating data manipulation and retrieval.

### Wallet and Transaction Models

- `src/models/Wallet.model.js` and `src/models/Transaction.model.js` represent the wallet and transaction entities, respectively.

## Services

Services abstract business logic from route handling, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

### Transaction and Wallet Services

- `src/services/transaction.service.js` manages the logic for transaction-related operations.
- Wallet operations are handled similarly, abstracting the logic from controllers.

## Task Scheduling for Transaction Updates

A scheduled task fetches and stores transactions from the Avalanche blockchain at regular intervals.

### Updating Transactions

- `src/task/storeTransactions.js` is executed periodically in PRODUCTION environment to update the local database with new transactions from the Avalanche network.

## Controllers and Routes

Controllers handle incoming requests and delegate to services for business logic processing. Routes define the API endpoints, mapping them to the appropriate controllers.

### Transaction and Wallet Controllers

- Controllers in `src/controllers` directory manage the application's business logic, interacting with the database through services.

### API Routing

- `src/routes/index.js` organizes the API endpoints, facilitating modular and maintainable code.

## Future Improvements and Expansions

While the current architecture provides a solid foundation for interfacing with the Avalanche blockchain and managing wallet and transaction data, there are several areas where the application can be further improved and expanded.

### Enhanced Data Fetching and Aggregation

- **Detailed API Fetching:** Expand the transaction update tasks to fetch more detailed information from the blockchain, such as transaction fees, gas prices, and transaction execution outcomes. This would provide a more comprehensive view of the network activity and allow for richer data analysis.
- **Data Aggregation:** Implement data aggregation functionalities that compile statistics on transactions, such as daily volumes, average transaction values, and trend analysis over time. This would offer valuable insights into network usage and asset flows, supporting advanced analytics capabilities.

### Improved Testing Practices

- **Test Coverage:** Increase the test coverage to include more edge cases and failure scenarios, ensuring the application behaves predictably under various conditions.
- **Validation and Assertion:** Strengthen the testing suite by adding more rigorous validations and assertions, particularly for data integrity, API response formats, and error handling pathways. This would help in catching bugs early in the development cycle and improve code quality.
- **Test Data Management:** Develop a more sophisticated test data setup that allows for easier replication of real-world scenarios, including blockchain interactions. Utilizing mocking frameworks or blockchain testnets can provide a more accurate testing environment, enabling the simulation of transactions without the need for live network calls.
- **Performance Testing:** Incorporate performance testing to evaluate the application's scalability and responsiveness under load. This is crucial for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing database queries and API calls for efficiency.

### Scalability and Deployment

- **Microservices Architecture:** Consider transitioning to a microservices architecture to improve scalability and ease of deployment. This approach would allow different components of the application (such as transaction fetching, data processing, and API serving) to scale independently based on demand.
- **Containerization:** Utilize containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to streamline deployment processes, enhance portability, and manage service scalability more effectively.

### User Interface and API Usability

- **API Documentation:** Continuously update the API documentation to reflect new features and endpoints, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for developers. Tools like Swagger can automate part of this process and provide interactive documentation.
- **Frontend Interface:** Develop a frontend interface that allows users to interact with the data more intuitively. This could include dashboards for visualizing transaction trends, wallet tracking features, and tools for analyzing blockchain data.

## Conclusion

The roadmap for future improvements highlights the potential to evolve the application into a more powerful tool for blockchain data analysis and interaction. By focusing on detailed data fetching, enhanced testing practices, scalability, and user interface development, the project can significantly extend its capabilities and utility.


## Conclusion

This architecture document outlines the high-level structure of the Avalanche blockchain interfacing application, detailing its configuration, middleware, database models, services, and task scheduling. The application is designed for scalability, maintainability, and efficient blockchain interaction.
