APIs to Develop:

a. Fetch Transactions:

Endpoint: /api/transactions
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves a list of recent USDC transactions on the Avalanche blockchain.
Query Parameters: start_date, end_date, address (optional)
Response: A list of transactions with details like transaction ID, sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, etc.
b. Aggregate Transactions:

Endpoint: /api/transactions/aggregate
Method: GET
Description: Provides aggregated data over a specified period.
Query Parameters: start_date, end_date, aggregate_type (e.g., daily, weekly)
Response: Aggregated transaction data such as total volume, number of transactions, etc.
c. Transaction Insights:

Endpoint: /api/transactions/insights
Method: GET
Description: Offers insights or summaries based on USDC transaction data.
Query Parameters: start_date, end_date
Response: Insights like most active addresses, peak transaction times, etc.
d. Transaction Details:

Endpoint: /api/transaction/{txId}
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves detailed information about a specific transaction.
Path Parameters: txId (transaction ID)
Response: Detailed information of the transaction.
Data to Store and Provide:

Transaction ID, Sender Address, Receiver Address, Transaction Amount, Timestamp, Transaction Fee, Block Number.
Aggregated Data: Total transaction volume, average transaction size, number of transactions per period (day/week/month).
Analytical Insights: Active user addresses, time analysis (peak hours for transactions), transaction patterns.
REST API Format:

Use RESTful principles for clear, intuitive API design.
Endpoints should be named logically to reflect the resources they are handling.
Use HTTP methods appropriately (GET for fetching data, POST for creating data, PUT/PATCH for updating, DELETE for removing).
Responses should be in JSON format.
Implement pagination for endpoints returning large data sets.
Ensure robust error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
Security and Performance:

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.
Use authentication (like OAuth tokens) where necessary.
Cache frequently accessed data to improve performance.
Consider using a load balancer if expecting high traffic.
Documentation:

Document your API endpoints with examples and expected response formats.
You might use tools like Swagger for API documentation.
